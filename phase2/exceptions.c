    A SYSCALL exception occurs when a SYSCALL assembler instruction is executed. After
    the processor and ROM-Exception handler actions when a SYSCALL point exception is 
    raised, continued executing the nucleus Exception handler. This nreakpoints, are 
    distinguidhed from a Breakpoint, exceptions by the contents of Cause.ExcCode in the
    SYSOldArea. There are 8 Sys calls, which are going to be defined with more detail in 
    each function documentation.
