    Nucleus guarantees finite progress (NO STARVATION), therefore, every ready process will
    have an opportunity to execute. For simplicityâ€™s sake this will be a simple round-robin
    scheduler with a time slice value of 5 milliseconds. Also performs some simple deadlock
    detention and executes the correct procedure.
